\section{conclusion}

This paper presented a custom OpenCV-based tracking model for bird detection and tracking in unconstrained natural videos, evaluated with a systematic evaluation. By explicitly addressing scale variation, camera motion, dynamic backgrounds, and non-bird distractors, the study answers key research questions regarding the feasibility, limitations, and efficiency–accuracy trade-offs of classical tracking designs when compared to modern deep-learning-based frameworks. While deep learning offers clear advantages in accuracy and robustness, classical motion-based methods retain value in scenarios with moderate complexity due to their efficiency and interpretability. The insights gained highlight the importance of balancing performance with resource constraints and motivate future investigations into hybrid approaches that leverage learned representations to complement motion-based cues.

Future work may incorporate lightweight appearance cues, improve handling of dense occlusions, or combine the proposed design with learned components to further narrow the performance gap.
